      This folder holds additional models, if needed by the application.

      /site/models/teamlist.php
      This file holds the model class RWKModelTeamList. This class must extend the base class JModel.
      Note that the view named TeamList will by default load a model called TeamList if it exists.
      Most models are named after the view they are intended to be used with, but this is not a requirement.

      /site/models/teamresult.php
      This file holds the model class RWKModelTeamResult. This class must extend the base class JModel.
      Note that the view named TeamResult will by default load a model called TeamResult if it exists.
      Most models are named after the view they are intended to be used with, but this is not a requirement.
